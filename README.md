This tool allows you to sideload custom VRM avatars onto your Quest for use in hAI! Friend MR. At present, this feature requires a special version of hAI! Friend MR that is available only through limited testing and is not yet released to the general public.

Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of any sideloaded VRM avatar complies with the terms and restrictions set by the avatar’s original author.
